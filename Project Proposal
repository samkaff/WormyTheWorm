WormyTheWorm

Goal:

Create a worm that targets devices on an internal network using nmap & ssh through python scripting.
The program will run an nmap scan to determine which machines have port 22 open. If port 22 is open,
the script will use a set list of usernames & passwords to attempt to gain access to the device via ssh shell.
Once the worm acquires access, it will create a file on the desktop titled “WormyWasHere”.
After this file is created, the worm will continue searching for open port 22s on the network & repeat the above steps. 

Test Environment:

We will set up an environment of multiple virtual machines on a host only network, some of which have port 22 open & some of which do not.
Several machines will have a username / password combination that appears on the set list, and some will not.
